# Array Data Structure

## Overview
An **array** is a fundamental data structure in computer science that stores a collection of elements. Each element in an array is identified by an index or a key. Arrays are widely used due to their simplicity and efficiency in accessing elements.

## Key Characteristics
- **Fixed Size**: The size of an array is determined at the time of creation and cannot be changed dynamically.
- **Homogeneous Elements**: All elements in an array are of the same data type.
- **Random Access**: Elements can be accessed directly using their index, making array access time O(1).
- **Contiguous Memory**: Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, which allows for efficient memory access.

## Basic Operations
1. **Access**: Retrieve an element by its index.
2. **Insertion**: Add an element at a specific index (may require shifting elements).
3. **Deletion**: Remove an element from a specific index (may require shifting elements).
4. **Search**: Find the index of a specific element.
5. **Update**: Modify the value of an element at a specific index.
